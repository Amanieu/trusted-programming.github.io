Here is the list of the opensource contributions made by huawei employees on the [ndarray crate](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray).

### (ndarray) Support `no_std`

This [pull request](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/864) added the support for `no_std`. The goal is to help developers use `ndarray` in embedded systems.

### (ndarray) Fix memory continuity judgment when stride is negative

This [pull request](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/885) improved the space utilization of the multidimensional array.

### (ndarray) Implement co-broadcasting in operator overloading

This [pull request](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/898) resolved interactions between arrays of different dimensions. It was followed by this [pull request](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/pull/965) to improve this feature's performance.
