Here is the list of the opensource contributions made by huawei employees on the [docs.rs project](https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs).

### (docs.rs) Add gitlab support

This [pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/pull/1249) adds the support for gitlab information retrieval (for example, the number of stars or forks of a repository) and also create the architecture to greatly improve and simplify the adds of other platforms.

### (docs.rs) Add footer to provide easier access to some information

We needed this [pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/pull/1367) when we were about to add a link to the privacy policy page: only issue is that the top navbar on docs.rs was already quite "full". So instead, we decided to create a footer to reduce the load on the top navbar and also use it to add this new link.
