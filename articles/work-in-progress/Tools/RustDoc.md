### Add "copy to clipboard" and "show hidden lines" for codeblocks

This [pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86892) adds both features in the title. It's common to copy code from the code block examples and also common to want to see the "full" code (including the eventual wrappers and so on).

### Improve search

This [pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90630) does two things:
 * Write a parser for the rustdoc search.


- [x] Code navigation
- [x] Improve Rustdoc UI: there are four ways to enhance UI, needs to decide which one is the best
- [x] Implementations need to be done.
- [ ] Need to make an RFC.
