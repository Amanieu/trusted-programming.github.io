**Potential Benefits**

* GCC compiled code may run 10% faster than the LLVM generated code.

* Support traditional targets where only GCC is available.

## Update

- [x] Merge code into Rust compiler branch
- [ ] Help with coordinating with Rust compiler experts
- [ ] Benchmarking performance in comparison with LLVM
